About BACS Project:

BACS is a banking standard in the UK.  This program was written to reformat payment files generated by
IFS applications, and convert them into the BACS banking format.  There are several areas in the source 
code which will need to be modified in order to customize the project for your company's application.


If you require assistance, please contact Dan above. 

Specifics:

Written in Visual studio 2015, C++ using standard libraries for string manipulation

This project was written for implementation specifically with IFS financials and BACS banking.  Any other application 
will require rework and documentation.  If interested, please contact dan@dzabinski.com
